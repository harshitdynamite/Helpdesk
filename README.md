# Helpdesk — AI-Powered Support Ticket System

> Built live on YouTube using Claude Code · Full Stack .NET + React series

This is the companion repository for the YouTube series **"Full Stack .NET + React with Claude Code"** — where we build a production-grade, AI-powered helpdesk from scratch, one phase at a time, using Claude Code as our development partner.

## 🧠 What We're Building

A fully functional AI-powered helpdesk that:

- Ingests support emails from **Gmail** and creates tickets automatically
- Uses **Claude AI** to classify, summarize, and draft replies
- Lets human agents **review, edit, and approve** every reply before it's sent
- Supports **role-based access** — Admin creates and manages Agent accounts
- Is built as a **production-grade, deployable system** — not a tutorial toy

### Dependency Direction (Clean Architecture)
```
Helpdesk.Api ──→ Helpdesk.Core ←── Helpdesk.Infrastructure
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [PostgreSQL 18](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

### Backend

```bash
# From the repo root
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project src/Helpdesk.Api
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
bun dev
```

### Database

```bash
# Set your connection string in user secrets
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:Helpdesk" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=helpdesk;Username=postgres;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD" --project src/Helpdesk.Api

# Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update --project src/Helpdesk.Infrastructure --startup-project src/Helpdesk.Api
```

## 📦 Current Phase

**✅ Phase 0 — Tooling & Solution Skeleton**
- .NET 10 solution with 3 projects (Api, Core, Infrastructure)
- React + TypeScript frontend via Bun
- Health check endpoint (`GET /api/health`)
- Frontend proxies API calls to backend
- CLAUDE.md project memory initialised
- Git repository with branch protection on `main`

**🔜 Next — Phase 1: Domain & Persistence**

## 📺 About the Series

This series is about showing what's actually possible when you combine a proper software engineering mindset with AI-powered development tools. Every architectural decision is explained. Every mistake is shown. No hand-waving.

By the end of the series you'll have seen how to build a complete, deployable, production-grade full stack application using:

- Clean Architecture in .NET
- EF Core migrations done right
- Role-based authentication
- AI pipelines with the Claude API
- Gmail integration
- Automated testing
